Developed an AR app named "Tapas's AR Diary".
This AR diary consists of 4 pages with a cover page. In every page, I tried to visualize and manipulate 3d objects in different ways, like.. rotation, scaling, video pop-up with audio, arrow button for explore multiple objects etc.

First, open the app. Then spot the camera in front of the 1st cover page of the diary. Then, some option will pop-up. If, we click "Start" button, the app will start for exploring the diary. If, we click "Info" button, some information about the app will be shown in the display. And if we click "Exit" button, the app will be quit.
